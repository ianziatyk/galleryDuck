Apple has killed off the matte screen.   I know…don’t all freak out at once.  For those who don’t know, Apple has offered a high-resolution anti-glare matte screen on all of their professional laptops dating back to the first MacBook Pro, and beyond.  One thing has to be said, Apple, the biggest tech company in the world, who has changed the way we use devices with their iPod, iPhone, and iPad, got to where they are today because of their computers, and they are, in my opinion, the best in the world.  They are amazingly complete products that appeal to an extremely large mass as well as very specific niches.  From students to professionals, apple, for many things, continues to be the right choice. Yet, because of the high demand of Apples other more consumer based products, Apples computer division only makes up 20% of total product manufacturing.  Only 20% and they make four Macintosh computers with many different options and performance levels, not just one or two like their iPad and iPhones.

The other day, Apple announced major upgrades to many of their computers, as they do every year.  Last year, the revolution is computer design was the coveted Retina display.  Apples proprietary technology that boasts the highest pixel density in any screen ever made.  These screens are beautiful, amazingly sharp with exceptionally high contrast.  Great for most consumers, for gaming, for watching movies or just reading text, but it offers a very unrealistic representation of the original image.  For professionals in any sort of visual field, this is a big problem.

In 2006 I bought my first Macintosh.  It was a 15-inch MacBook pro with a 2.16 GHz processor and 2GB of RAM, a great computer that at the time far exceeded my needs and expectations.  Like many in my generation, I grew up almost exclusively using PC’s, and even at a young age I was relatively proficient, but transitioning to the Operating System Mac OS X was a breeze, and I was instantly hooked.  Although slow, that computer still runs today.  Originally when I bought the thing I thought I may be doing some video editing, or hoped to, so I got advice from the sales people to get the matte screen option, which at the time was standard. I didn’t think anything of it, many screens especially desktop LCD flat screen monitors were matte at the time (not glossy) so I was used to it.  I used Adobe Photoshop heavily in high school and continued to lightly on this new MacBook Pro but didn’t get into the video editing as I thought I would have.  Probably around 2008, as the excitement for that new MacBook had completely vanished, I remember seeing a friends computer that was exactly the same, but he had paid extra for a glossy LCD, I was blown away, the color was rich, the blacks were deep, the text looked sharper, and you could clean it so easily, THAT’S IT! the next computer I get Is going to have a glossy screen.

In 2010 my life started to go in a slightly new direction.  With some friends I started a productions company and we headed to New Orleans to make a documentary about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which at the time was still leaking.  It was finally my time for video editing and extensive work on Photoshop.  At the time we had my 2006 MacBook Pro and a 2008 MacBook Pro.  The newer Macbook immediately was recruited for the heavy lifting as far as video editing, although it was being seriously over worked, and mine was used pretty much exclusively for any graphic design and still photography.  An already 4-year-old computer was essentially rendered useless for video editing on Final cut Pro.

After another year or so it was time to say so long to old-faithful and invest in an upgrade.  At the time, and currently, all MacBook Pros come standard with a glossy LCD screen, and until the other day came with the option of a higher-res glossy, or  higher-res anti-glare matte screen.  For Professionals, the matte screen offers a view more similar to that of print.  The colors are more accurate, the contrast is more realistic and it is easier to calibrate.  There is also no reflection, so what you see is what you get, which also means you can work in the sun, and there is considerably less eyestrain.   When you may have to spend hours a day looking at your computer screen, this is very important….but back to me.   When I went to buy a new computer I wasn’t aware of all of these benefits, I had been using a matte screen for years and just wanted some excitement in my life, so I sprang for a new MacBook Pro with all the fixing’s, brought it home from the store, and noticed it had a matte screen.  Not a normal glossy screen but a matte screen. I was underwhelmed.  Since it was after store hours I decided to play with it for the night, and I started to do some research.  I realized that this mistake actually worked for my benefit financially because the matte screen was now an upgrade and it had me very curious.  In my research I found all of this writing in forums from professionals who did similar things with photos and video and raved about that matte screen, after the two week period was almost up where I had to make up my mind before I could not longer return it, I made up my mind, matte screen for life.

Several years later I am extremely happy with my decision and as I do more and more professional work I couldn’t be happier with the screen.  As a company we invested in an iMac, which is another beautiful Apple computer that has a whompping 29-inch glossy display and I find myself preferring to use my own computer because the iMac is like looking in a very nice black mirror.

As my own computer starts to show her age I will join the group of people who is scolding Apple for counting us out, but who can really blame them.  They simply cant justify offering a product that doesn’t sell.  I hope another company comes along and offers a matte screen laptop that rivals an Apple computer so we can have some friendly competition in the computer manufacturing world once again and give the professional market affordable options, not just consumer market.</textarea>
